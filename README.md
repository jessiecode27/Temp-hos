### Temp-hos
# Relationship between high temperature and hospitalizations in multiple regions
# The analysis has two main parts: 1) Calculate the effects of high temperature/ heatwaves on hospitalizations in each region; 2) Estimate the pooled effects of high temperature/ heatwaves on hospitalizations for multiple regions by multivariate meta-analysis 
# all_temp1: temperature and hospitalizations in the first stage
# all6ctities_temp2: temperature and hospitalizations in the second stage
# all2_hw1: heatwaves and hospitalizations in the first stage
# all2_hw2: heatwaves and hospitalizations in the second stage
